title: About
---

My name is Warwick Masson - I'm a data scientist and developer from South Africa.
I'm interested in robotics, machine learning,
functional programming languages and just about anything else that sparks my curiosity.

I'm currently a data scientist at the [Isazi Consulting](http://www.isaziconsulting.co.za).
I completed an Msc in Computer Science at the [University of the Witwatersrand](http://www.wits.ac.za).

You can contact me at warwick dot masson at gmail dot com. 

As it says at the bottom, this website was and is generated using the awesome haskell static site generator [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll).
It's hosted using github pages, so the html and hakyll source for it is available on my [github account here](https://github.com/WarwickMasson).
